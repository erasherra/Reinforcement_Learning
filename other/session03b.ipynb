On each iteration start at every (non-terminating) state and sample actions in succeeding states by selecting them from uniform distribution (each action - up, down, left, right - is equally probable). Run the episode until terminal state is encountered. Collect statistics to calculate average number of steps needed before completion for each start state. Should this number match with something you have seen earlier in the exercises?"
